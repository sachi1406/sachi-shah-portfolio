# Portfolio
This is my (Sachi Shah) public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
✨ "Turning data puzzles into aha moments!" 

Hi, I’m Sachi!
I love exploring how data can turn uncertainty into opportunity. I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Information Systems Management (Business Intelligence & Data Analytics) at Carnegie Mellon University. I’m on a mission to turn complex data into clear, actionable insights that solve meaningful problems.

I bring hands-on experience in data engineering, machine learning, and analytics, along with a passion for storytelling through data. Beyond the numbers, I enjoy leading teams, mentoring peers, and bringing people together to solve problems creatively.

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

1. Sharpen my ability to tell compelling stories with data, not just present numbers.
2. Learn how to design clear, engaging, intuitive and accessible visualizations.
3. Balance aesthetics with accuracy to make insights resonate with different audiences.
4. Experiment with interactive tools and visual techniques to make data more impactful.
5. Gain confidence in using storytelling as a bridge between technical analysis and decision-making.
